## 📂 Project Descriptions  
### 1️⃣ OpenCV Basic Operations  
- Image processing techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, and filtering.  
- Video processing with OpenCV.  

### 2️⃣ Mediapipe Projects  
#### ✋ Hand Tracking  
- Tracks and identifies hand landmarks in real-time.  
- Used for gesture recognition and virtual controls.  

#### 😀 Face Detection  
- Detects and tracks faces using Mediapipe’s built-in face detection model.  

#### 🕸️ Face Mesh  
- Extracts 468 facial landmarks for applications like AR filters and expression analysis.  

#### 🏃 Pose Estimation  
- Identifies body keypoints for fitness tracking, gesture-based interactions, and movement analysis.  

### 3️⃣ YOLOv8 Object Detection  
- Utilizes Ultralytics YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.  
- Supports custom dataset training and inference on images and videos.
